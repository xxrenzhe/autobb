# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a new repository initialized for a Next.js/TypeScript project. The `.gitignore` indicates plans for a Next.js application with TypeScript.

## Initial Setup Required

This repository does not yet have a working codebase. Before development can begin:

1. Initialize the project structure
2. Install dependencies
3. Set up configuration files

## Expected Technology Stack

Based on `.gitignore`:
- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Package Manager**: npm/yarn/pnpm (to be determined)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (indicated by `.vercel` ignore)

## Development Workflow (Once Initialized)

Standard Next.js commands will likely be:
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm test` - Run tests (if configured)

## Environment Variables

The project will use environment variables (`.env` files are gitignored). Check for `.env.example` or documentation for required variables.

## Notes for Future Development

- This is a fresh repository - establish coding standards and architecture early
- Consider documenting key architectural decisions as the project grows
- Update this CLAUDE.md with actual commands and architecture once implemented
